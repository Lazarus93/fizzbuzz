# FizzBuzz Rest API

Steps :
# Run all tests in the project.
make test

# To build and run the Docker container, you would use these commands:

# Build the Docker image
make build

# Run the Docker container
make run

This will start the fizzbuzz server inside a Docker container and map port 8080 inside the container to port 8080 on host machine, so you can access the server at http://localhost:8080.
